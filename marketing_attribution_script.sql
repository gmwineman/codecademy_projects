-- Project Assignment: Marketing Attribution

-- CoolTShirts, an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns. In this project, youâ€™ll be helping them answer these questions about their campaigns:

-- 1. Get familiar with the company.
-- How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use and how are they related? Be sure to explain the difference between utm_campaign and utm_source.
-- What pages are on their website?

-- 2. What is the user journey?
-- How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
-- How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
-- How many visitors make a purchase?
-- How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?
-- What is the typical user journey?

-- 3. Optimize the campaign budget.
-- CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Which should they pick and why?

-- note: you will have to adjust timestamp column to make it compatible 

-- importing timeseries data has resulted in errors, had to separate date and time into two columns to avoid issues when uploading.
-- can only upload date and time columns as text data types

/*
SELECT * FROM page_visits LIMIT 10;
-- need to rejoin the two separate columns 
SELECT page_name, concat(date," ",time), user_id, utm_campaign, utm_source

UPDATE page_visits
SET date = concat(date," ",time) ; 
ALTER TABLE page_visits
DROP COLUMN time ; 
ALTER TABLE page_visits
RENAME COLUMN date TO timestamp ;

-- #7 CoolTShirts can reinvest in 5 campaigns. Given your findings, which ones should they pick and why?
-- medium and nytimes generate the most first_touches for the website, but generage some of the least last touches
-- email and facebook sources generate the most amount of last touches, and ultimately the most purchases
-- I would recommend reinvesting in the minterview-with-cool-tshirts-founder, getting-to-know-cool-tshirts, ten-crazy-cool-tshirts-facts  campaigns as they generate the most first touches for the busines
-- I would also recommend reinvesting in the weekly-newsletter and retargetting-ad campaigns as they genereate the most purchases
